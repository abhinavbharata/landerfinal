This example is given as a unit test example. We comare the results betwwen the FEM method and rigid body approach. 
The initial configuration of the double pendulum is given as initial_config.png.
The mass of the two bars in the double pendulum is m1 = m2 = m with a length of l1 = l2 = l. 

This folder has two files:
1. 'FEM_solution' is the dynamic analysis of the double pendulum by TsgFEM code.
2. 'Analytcal_solution' is the analytical solution of the dynamic of the double pendulum.
